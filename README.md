# rock-paper-scissors-ai
Hey everyone! This project is all about data collection, data analysis, and using data to program an AI for rock paper scissors. Through this project, everyone involved will learn many skills related to and a part of computer science, including the project managers! The focus is to collect as much data as a possible and make an AI that can win most of the time against a human.

# weekly-meeting
Meetings will be 6-8 pm on wednseday weekly.

# member-expectations
As for expectations, you are not expected to know much about AI or anything along those lines. But, a good attitude and a willingness to learn is something that would be very good to have. And as we are the project managers, we will also try and learn from everyone else, since there are going to be some people that are very knowledgable in many topics.
